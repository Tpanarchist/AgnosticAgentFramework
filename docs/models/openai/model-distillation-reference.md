## Implementation Patterns
```python
# Store Large Model Outputs
def store_model_output(prompt, metadata):
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": "User input"}
        ],
        store=True,
        metadata=metadata
    )

# Evaluation Setup
class DistillationEvaluator:
    def evaluate_models(self, test_data, models):
        results = {}
        for model in models:
            scores = []
            for test in test_data:
                response = self.get_model_response(model, test.input)
                score = self.evaluate_response(
                    response, 
                    test.expected
                )
                scores.append(score)
            results[model] = {
                "mean_score": np.mean(scores),
                "std_score": np.std(scores)
            }
        return results
    
    def evaluate_response(self, response, expected):
        # Implement evaluation logic
        pass

# Training Data Preparation
class TrainingDataPreparator:
    def filter_completions(self, criteria):
        return client.completions.list(
            filter=criteria
        )
    
    def prepare_training_data(self, completions):
        return [{
            "messages": completion.messages,
            "metadata": completion.metadata
        } for completion in completions]
