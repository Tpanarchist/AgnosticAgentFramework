    usage_tracking: |
      {
        "total_tokens": int,

        "completion_tokens": int,
        "completion_tokens_details": {
          "reasoning_tokens": int
        }
      }
```

## Implementation Examples
```python
# Basic Reasoning Task
def solve_complex_problem(prompt):
    return client.chat.completions.create(
        model="o1-preview",
        messages=[{
            "role": "user",
            "content": prompt
        }],
        max_completion_tokens=25000  # Buffer for reasoning
    )

# Token Management
class ReasoningTokenManager:
    def calculate_available_tokens(self, prompt_tokens):
        context_window = 128000
        reasoning_buffer = 25000
        return context_window - prompt_tokens - reasoning_buffer
    
    def set_max_completion_tokens(self, available_tokens):
        return min(available_tokens, 32768)  # o1-preview limit
```

## Best Practices
```yaml
prompting_guidelines:
  recommended:
    - "Keep prompts simple and direct"
    - "Use clear delimiters for distinct parts"
    - "Include only relevant context"
    - "Focus on the core problem"
  
  avoid:
    - "Chain-of-thought prompting"
    - "Step-by-step instructions"
    - "Excessive context"
    - "Complex prompt engineering"

token_management:
  strategies:
    - "Reserve adequate reasoning buffer"
    - "Monitor token usage patterns"
    - "Adjust max_completion_tokens based on task"
    - "Track reasoning token consumption"

error_handling:
  completion_length:
    - "Monitor finish_reason for 'length'"
    - "Adjust token allocation if needed"
    - "Handle partial completions"
    - "Implement retry logic with larger buffers"
```

## Use Case Optimization
```yaml
optimal_applications:
  coding:
    - "Algorithm implementation"
    - "Code refactoring"
    - "Optimization problems"

    - "Complex calculations"
    - "Proof validation"
    - "Mathematical modeling"
    
  science:
