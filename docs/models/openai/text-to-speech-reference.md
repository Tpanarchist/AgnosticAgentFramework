## Implementation Examples
```python
# Basic Text-to-Speech Generation
class TTSGenerator:
    def generate_speech(self, text, voice="alloy", model="tts-1"):
        return client.audio.speech.create(
            model=model,
            voice=voice,
            input=text
        )
    
    def save_to_file(self, response, filepath):
        response.stream_to_file(filepath)

# Streaming Implementation
class TTSStreamer:
    def stream_audio(self, text, voice="alloy"):
        response = client.audio.speech.create(
            model="tts-1",
            voice=voice,
            input=text
        )
        
        for chunk in response.iter_bytes():
            yield chunk
```

## Language Support
```yaml
supported_languages:
  base_model: "Follows Whisper model support"
  languages:
    european:
      - "English"
      - "French"
      - "German"
      - "Spanish"
      - "Italian"
      # ... [other European languages]
    
    asian:
      - "Chinese"
      - "Japanese"
      - "Korean"
      # ... [other Asian languages]
    
    other:
      - "Arabic"
      - "Hindi"
      - "Swahili"
      # ... [other languages]

  notes:
    - "Performs well despite English-optimized voices"
    - "Input text can be in any supported language"
```

## Best Practices
```yaml
implementation:
  streaming:
    - "Use streaming for real-time applications"
    - "Handle chunk processing efficiently"
    - "Implement proper error handling"
    
  quality:
    - "Choose model based on use case"
    - "Use tts-1-hd for professional content"
    - "Use tts-1 for real-time applications"
    
  format_selection:
    - "Use MP3 for general purpose"
    - "Use OPUS for low-latency streaming"
    - "Use FLAC for archival purposes"
    
  compliance:
    - "Always disclose AI-generated nature"
    - "Maintain proper usage rights"
    - "Follow platform-specific guidelines"
```

## Framework Integration Considerations
```yaml
integration_patterns:
  audio_handling:
    - "Implement efficient streaming handlers"
    - "Support multiple output formats"
    - "Handle file management"
    
  caching:
    - "Cache common audio snippets"
    - "Implement intelligent cache invalidation"
    - "Handle storage efficiently"
    
  error_handling:
    - "Handle network interruptions"
    - "Manage timeouts appropriately"
    - "Provide fallback mechanisms"
    
  monitoring:
    - "Track API usage"
    - "Monitor audio quality"
    - "Log generation metrics"
```

## Limitations and Considerations
```yaml
current_limitations:
  emotional_control:
    supported: false
    note: "No direct mechanism for emotional output control"
    
  voice_customization:
    supported: false
    note: "Custom voice creation not available"
    
  performance:
    latency: "Varies by model and format"
    streaming: "Requires proper chunk handling"
    
  language:
    optimization: "Voices optimized for English"
    quality: "May vary for non-English languages"
```
