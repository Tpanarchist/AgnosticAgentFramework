## Implementation Examples
```python
# Clear Instructions Example
def create_structured_prompt(task, format, examples=None):
    prompt = f"""
    Task: {task}
    Required Format: {format}
    """
    if examples:
        prompt += f"\nExamples:\n{examples}"
    return prompt

# Reference Text Integration
def augment_with_references(prompt, references):
    return f"""
    Use the following references to answer the question:
    References:
    {references}

    Question: {prompt}
    
    Base your answer only on the provided references.
    """

# Task Decomposition
class TaskDecomposer:
    def split_task(self, task):
        subtasks = []
        # 1. Analyze task complexity
        # 2. Identify logical breakpoints
        # 3. Create subtask sequence
        return subtasks
    
    def execute_subtasks(self, subtasks):
        results = []
        for subtask in subtasks:
            result = self.execute_single_task(subtask)
            results.append(result)
        return self.combine_results(results)

# Chain of Thought
def generate_with_reasoning(prompt):
    return f"""
    Let's approach this step by step:
    1. First, understand the problem
    2. Break down the components
    3. Analyze each part
    4. Formulate a solution

## Best Practices
```yaml
instruction_design:
  clarity:
    - "Be specific about requirements"
    - "Define expected format"
    - "Include success criteria"
    - "Provide context"
  
  examples:
    - "Show don't tell"
    - "Include diverse cases"
    - "Demonstrate edge cases"
    - "Explain example choices"

context_management:
  organization:
    - "Use clear delimiters"
    - "Structure information logically"
    - "Prioritize relevant details"
    - "Maintain consistency"
  
  reference_handling:
    - "Cite sources explicitly"
    - "Verify information accuracy"
    - "Update outdated information"
    - "Track source reliability"

task_optimization:
  decomposition:
    - "Identify subtask boundaries"
    - "Manage dependencies"
    - "Track completion states"
    - "Handle failures gracefully"
  
  validation:
    - "Verify outputs"
    - "Check reasoning steps"
