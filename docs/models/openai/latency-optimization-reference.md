# Latency Optimization Guide (PGIRPWD Framework)

## 1. Process Tokens Faster
```yaml
optimization_strategies:
  model_selection:
    principle: "Smaller models run faster"
    techniques:
      - "Use longer, detailed prompts"
      - "Add more few-shot examples"
      - "Implement fine-tuning/distillation"
    
  compute_optimization:
    hardware:
      - "Faster infrastructure"
      - "Lower engine saturation"
      - "Optimized compute resources"

  performance_metrics:
    - "Tokens per minute (TPM)"
    - "Tokens per second (TPS)"
    - "Processing speed"
```

## 2. Generate Fewer Tokens
```yaml
output_reduction:
  natural_language:
    methods:
      - "Request concise responses"
      - "Set word/length limits"
      - "Use few-shot examples"
      - "Fine-tune for brevity"
    
  structured_output:
    optimizations:
      - "Minimize syntax overhead"
      - "Shorten function names"
      - "Omit named arguments"
      - "Coalesce parameters"
    
  controls:
    parameters:
      - "max_tokens"
      - "stop_tokens"
      - "Response limiting"
```

## 3. Input Token Reduction
```yaml
token_reduction_strategies:
  fine_tuning:
    purpose: "Replace lengthy instructions"
    benefit: "Reduced context size"
  
  context_optimization:
    methods:
      - "Filter RAG results"
      - "Clean HTML/markup"
      - "Remove redundant content"
    
  prompt_structure:
    technique: "Maximize shared prefix"
    benefits:
      - "KV cache friendly"
      - "Reduced processing tokens"
    location: "Dynamic content at end"
```

## 4. Minimize Requests
```yaml
request_optimization:
  consolidation:
    technique: "Combine sequential steps"
    benefits:
      - "Reduced round-trips"
      - "Simplified processing"
    
  implementation:
    method: "Single prompt, enumerated steps"
    output: "Structured JSON with named fields"
    benefit: "Easy parsing and reference"
```

## 5. Parallelize Operations
```yaml
parallelization_strategies:
  independent_tasks:
    approach: "Parallel execution"
    benefit: "No cumulative latency"
    
  sequential_tasks:
    technique: "Speculative execution"
    use_case: "Predictable outcomes"
    example: "Moderation checks"
    
  implementation:
    steps:
      - "Start multiple steps simultaneously"
      - "Verify critical path results"
      - "Cancel/retry if needed"
```

## 6. User Wait Reduction
```yaml
user_experience:
  streaming:
    impact: "Immediate visibility"
    benefit: "Perceived faster response"
    
  chunking:
    process: "Progressive processing"
    benefits:
      - "Early content display"
      - "Background processing"
    
  progress_indication:
    methods:
      - "Show processing steps"
      - "Loading states"
      - "Progress bars"
      - "Status updates"
```

## 7. Don't Default to LLM
```yaml
alternative_approaches:
  static_content:
    methods:
      - "Hard-coded responses"
      - "Pre-computed outputs"
      - "Standard messages"
    
  ui_optimization:
    components:
      - "Custom UI elements"
      - "Direct data display"
      - "Traditional interfaces"
    
  classical_techniques:
    - "Binary search"
    - "Caching"
    - "Hash maps"
    - "Runtime optimization"
```

## Implementation Example
```yaml
steps:
  initial_analysis:
    - "Map current architecture"
    - "Identify sequential operations"
    - "Locate optimization opportunities"
  
  optimizations:
    - "Combine related prompts"
    - "Switch to smaller models"
    - "Parallelize operations"
    - "Reduce token usage"
    
  validation:
    - "Measure improvements"
    - "Test response quality"
    - "Monitor performance"
    - "Document results"
```
